I use the depth image 5 and 6 to perform the The Assignment

5)describe the reasoning about the values given to ICP parameters, in order to obtain the best results.
The selection of ICP parameters involves balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.
Start with a moderate voxel size to reduce noise and computation time, 
choose a max correspondence distance based on expected alignment, set tight convergence criteria for precision, 
and use Point-to-Plane for surface alignment.
Adjust these parameters iteratively based on the specific characteristics of your point clouds and the desired accuracy of the alignment.
